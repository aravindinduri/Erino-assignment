# Contact Management App

This is a full-stack Contact Management application built with React for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and a MongoDB database to store contact information. The application allows users to add, edit, and manage contacts.

The frontend uses Material-UI for the user interface, and the backend is powered by Express.js, providing an API for CRUD operations on contacts.

## Features

- **Add New Contact**: Users can add new contacts with required fields like First Name, Last Name, Email, and Phone Number.
- **Edit Existing Contact**: Users can edit the details of an existing contact.
- **Delete Contact**: Users can delete contacts.
- **Validation**: The form includes real-time validation for email and phone numbers, showing errors when fields are incorrectly filled.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Success Notification**: Upon saving or editing a contact, a success message is shown using a Snackbar.
- **Backend API**: A REST API is provided for handling CRUD operations on contacts.
